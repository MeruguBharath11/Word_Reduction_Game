# Word_Reduction_Game
A simple and fun browser-based game where players try to guess the reduced form of a word. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔍 How It Works

- A random word is shown to the player.
- The player guesses the "reduced" version of that word (typically the word with the last 3 characters removed).
- The app checks the answer, updates the score, and moves on to the next word.
- After all words are used, the game ends.

## 🧠 Example

If the word is **"running"**, the correct reduced form would be **"run"**.
